## Background

### The Problem

In today's world, staying active is harder than ever. Millions of people face barriers such as:

* Lack of time or motivation  
* No access to gyms or trainers  
* High cost of personalized coaching  
* Confusion about how and what to train  

### Why It Matters

The World Health Organization reports over 1.4 billion adults worldwide are not physically active enough. Inactivity is a risk factor for obesity, mental health issues, and chronic diseases.

### Personal Motivation

I designed FitBuddy to be the kind of coach I wish I had: available 24/7, affordable, empathetic, and smart enough to adjust to my progress.

## How is it used?

FitBuddy is accessed via a mobile app or website. It works in 4 steps:

1. **Onboarding**: The user provides basic data (age, goals, schedule, preferences).  
2. **Plan Generation**: FitBuddy creates a tailored weekly workout plan.  
3. **Interaction**: Users receive reminders and use the chatbot to give feedback or ask for alternatives.  
4. **Adaptation**: The AI adapts plans based on user behavior and outcomes.

**User types:**  
- Beginners or inactive users  
- People with time or budget constraints  
- Users who prefer home workouts  
- Individuals with specific goals (e.g. weight loss, rehab)

## Data sources and AI methods

### Data Sources

- [UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)  
- User input: age, weight, preferences, feedback  
- Future: wearable integration (Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch)

### AI Techniques

| Task | Method |
|------|--------|
| Workout classification | Supervised learning (Random Forest, SVM) |
| Adaptive planning | Reinforcement learning |
| Chat support | NLP (transformer-based dialog models) |

```python
# Simple workout suggestion logic
def suggest_workout(level, goal):
    if level == "beginner" and goal == "weight_loss":
        return "Walk 30 minutes + bodyweight circuit (3 rounds)"
    elif level == "intermediate":
        return "Full body strength training (push/pull/legs)"
    elif level == "advanced":
        return "HIIT session + progressive overload plan"

Challenges
‚ùå Does not replace a licensed medical or physiotherapy service

üîç Dependent on accurate and consistent user data

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires strong data privacy and ethical use protocols

üß† Bias in model training if data is not inclusive

What next?
Planned developments:

Wearable integration (real-time feedback and tracking)

Emotional intelligence in chatbot replies (via sentiment analysis)

Multilingual support (Italian, Spanish, Hindi)

Partnerships with gyms, health coaches, and insurers

Needed support:

Data scientists with healthcare AI experience

UX designers for mobile experience

Cloud engineers for backend deployment

Volunteer users for beta testing and feedback
